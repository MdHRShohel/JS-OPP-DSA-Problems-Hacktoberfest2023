// Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

// Problem Solution:
var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
    let fast = head, slow = head
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) fast = fast.next
    if (!fast) return head.next
    while (fast.next) fast = fast.next, slow = slow.next
    slow.next = slow.next.next
    return head
};
